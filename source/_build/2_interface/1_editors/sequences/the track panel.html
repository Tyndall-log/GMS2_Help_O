<h2>The Track Panel</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/track_panel.png" alt=
"The Track Panel">
</p>

<p>What your sequences do are governed by the assets and parameters
that have been added to the Track Panel. You can add a track to the
editor by either:</p>

<ul>
<li>dragging an asset into the sequence <a href=
"the%20sequence%20canvas.html">Canvas</a><br>
<br></li>

<li>dragging an asset into the Track Panel itself<br>
<br></li>

<li>by clicking the "Add Asset" <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_addasset.png"> button at the bottom of the Track
Panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last method will open the Asset Explorer for you where you
can choose the asset to add.</p>

<p>Regardless of the method you choose, a new <b>Asset Track</b>
will be made for the asset. This track is the main track for the
asset in the sequence and will have a corresponding <b>key
track</b> created for the asset in the <a href=
"using%20the%20dope%20sheet.html">Dope Sheet</a> at the playhead
position:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/track_editor_add_asset.gif" alt=
"Add An Asset To The Track Panel"></p>

<p>Note that the colour of the Asset Key in the Dope Sheet can be
set from the Track Panel by clicking the coloured bar at the end.
This will open up the Colour Picker where you can choose which
colour to use for the key tracks in the Dope Sheet.</p>

<p>Each asset in the track editor can also have a set of
<b>Parameter Tracks</b> added to it. These tracks are what control
the various different properties (parameters) that can be modified
for the track over time. The different parameters available are
covered in depth in the section on "Adding Parameter Tracks"
further down this page, but to give you an idea of what's available
here is a brief list:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>All Assets</b>: <i>Position</i> and <i>rotation</i>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Sounds</b>: <i>Pitch</i> and <i>Volume</i>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Sequences</b>: <i>Origin</i> and <i>Scale</i>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Sprites</b> and <b>Objects</b>: <i>Origin</i>, <i>Scale</i>,
<i>Image Index</i>, <i>Image Speed</i>, <i>Colour Add</i> and
<i>Colour Blend</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To add a parameter track in the editor you can enable
"Automatically Record Changes" <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../images/icon_seq_record.png"> in the Track Panel, which will
then add parameter keys for any changes you make to an asset in the
Canvas at the current playhead position, as shown here:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/canvas_add_keys.gif" alt=
"Adding A Parameter Key To An Asset In The Canvas"></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can click the "Add Parameter Track"
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_addparameter.png"> button, which will open up a menu
showing you the different options available: <img class="center"
src="images/track_editor_add_parameter.png" alt=
"Adding A Parameter Track To An Asset In The Track Panel"></p>

<p>Selecting any option from this menu, or recording directly from
the IDE, will create one or more parameter tracks underneath the
main asset track, and also add a parameter key to the Dope Sheet,
coloured the same as the main asset track colour: <img class=
"center" src="images/track_editor_parametertracks.png" alt=
"Parameter Tracks In The Track Panel And Dope Sheet"></p>

<p>Once you add a parameter track to your main asset track, the
dope sheet will have a coloured bar to show the length of the asset
track in frames, and there will be <b>parameter keys</b> added at
the points where you want a change in the parameter to occur. These
keys can be seen in the above image as simple "dots" on a frame.
When a track has parameter keys like this, the parameter they refer
to will be interpolated by default between each of the points
shown. For example, if you have a rotation parameter and at frame 0
it is set to 90° then at frame 30 it is 180°, then at frame 15 it
will be 135°. You can actually see the change in values over time
by selecting the parameter track and then "scrubbing" the playhead
in the dope sheet:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src=
"images/track_editor_changing_parameter.gif" alt=
"Interpolating Between Parameter Keys"></p>

<p><br>
Note that for all parameter tracks you can disable the default
linear interpretation between different keys from the right mouse
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_rmb.png"> menu on the parameter track, which
means that transitions between parameter values will occur
instantly on the given frame rather than gradually over time:
<img class="center" src="images/track_editor_rmb_menu_params.png"
alt="Disable Linear Interpolation On Parameter Track"></p>

<p>Apart from being able to choose the transition type for
parameter tracks, the RMB menu also offers you the following
options:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b>, and <b>Paste</b>: These options permit
you to cut/copy/paste asset or parameter tracks.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Duplicate Track(s)</b>: This will create a duplicate of the
currently selected track(s). If this is an<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Delete Track(s)</b>: This will delete the selected track or
tracks. If you delete an asset track, then the parameter tracks
associated with it will also be removed, however you can delete
parameter tracks individually.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Group</b>: Using this option on an empty space in the Track
Panel will create a group folder which you can then use to help
keep your assets in a more orderly format. You can add an asset to
a group by simply clicking on it and dragging it onto the folder.
If you have already selected a track or tracks, then using this
option will not only create a group folder, but it will add the
track(s) to it.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Rename</b>: You can use this option to rename any asset
track or group folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>An important feature of asset and parameter tracks is the
ability to <b>parent</b> tracks and groups. If you drag an asset
track onto another one in the track panel, the first asset becomes
a <b>child</b> of the asset it was dropped on, which in turn
becomes the <b>parent</b>. All parameter tracks assigned to the
parent asset track will then automatically be applied to the child
asset tracks, so you can have multiple sprites (for example) all
using a single position asset track to move:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/track_editor_parenting.gif" alt=
"Parent And Child Sprites Share Parameters"></p>

<p><br>
The same can be done using <b>groups</b>. You can create a group
folder by clicking the button at the bottom of the track panel and
then drag and drop the asset tracks you want to be grouped together
on the group folder. These assets will still retain their own
parameter tracks, but you can then give additional parameter tracks
to the group and all the assets in the group will be affected by
these parameter tracks <i>as well as</i> their own individual
parameter tracks.</p>

<p>When working with the track panel the usual keyboard shortcuts
can be used too, ie: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> / <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../../images/icon_cmd.png"> and the
left mouse button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_lmb.png"> to select one or more tracks in any
order, <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_shift.png"> and the left mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_lmb.png"> to select consecutive tracks, and
you can also cut, copy and paste tracks using the <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> /
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + "X", <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> /
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + "C" and <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> /
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + "V" key combinations.</p>

<p>That's the basics of using the track editor, but below we go
into a bit more detail on what each of the different sections are
for and how to use them:</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote><a name="sequence_name" id="sequence_name"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="1">Sequence Name</label> <input id="1"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This tab simply shows the name of the sequence that is currently
being edited. you can perform a slow double click <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the
tab to change the name if required. All sequence names must use
alpha-numeric values only, along with the under-bar "_" symbol, and
cannot start with a number.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="search" id="search"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"2">Track Search</label> <input id="2" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This search box permits you to quickly search through the
various tracks of the sequence to find the one you wish to edit.
Typing any text here will tell you how many asset tracks have been
found with that string in them, and also highlight the arrows to
the side of the search box. Clicking these arrows will skip to the
first and consecutive assets that fulfill the search criteria.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="asset_track" id="asset_track"></a> <label class="collapse"
for="3">Asset Tracks</label> <input id="3" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Each asset that is added to a sequence will be given its own
track, and these are listed here. If the asset track has any
parameters set for it, then these will also be shown underneath as
parameter tracks. You can expand or contract the parameter tracks
by clicking on the arrow icon to the left of the track name, and
you can edit the track name by using a slow double click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the track and then giving it the
name of your choice. Note that there are no restrictions on the
name you give and you can use spaces, non alpha-numeric characters
and start them with a number if you wish.</p>

<p>The different types of parameter tracks available are explained
in more detail in the section on "Adding Parameter Tracks" further
down this page.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="key_controls" id="key_controls"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="4">Key Controls</label> <input id="4" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Once you have added a parameter track, you can add and remove
<b>parameter keys</b> to specific frames to set the value for that
parameter. This can be done using the "Record Key" or "Delete key"
button (see the section on "Track Key Controls" for more
information), or you can do it using the <b>Key Controls</b> on the
parameter itself. To use these controls, you need to position the
playhead in the Dope Sheet to the frame you want to edit, and then
you can click the circular "key" icon on the left of the parameter
track. If the frame has no key assigned to it the circle will be
"empty" and clicking it will add a new key and allow you to edit
the parameter value. If the frame has a key already, then the
circle will be "filled" and clicking it will instead remove the key
from the frame:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/track_editor_add_param_key.gif"
alt="Adding And Removing Parameter Keys Using The Track Panel"><br>
<br>
You'll notice too that in the image above you can use the arrow
buttons on either side of the parameter key marker to quickly skip
between key frames in the dope sheet too, without having to
position the playhead manually.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="parameter_values" id="parameter_values"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="5">Parameter Values</label> <input id="5" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When a parameter track has been added, you can edit the values
for some of them by simply setting the playhead in the Dope Sheet
to the frame with the key you want to change and then use the
different canvas widgets to edit the position, rotation, scale or
origin of the asset. These changes will be reflected in the key
value for that frame. However not all parameters can be edited this
way, or it may not be precise enough for your needs, and in those
cases you can edit the parameter value directly by clicking on it
in the track and setting it to the required value for the parameter
type.</p>

<p>Note that some parameter tracks may have a "link" icon
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_track_link.png"> next to their values, which means
they can be linked together. This is done by clicking the icon to
enable/disable linking, and when enabled, editing one value will
also set the other.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="events" id="events"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"11">Events</label> <input id="11" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>In a similar way to regular objects, sequences can have
<b>events</b> that can run some code assigned to them. The code is
assigned in the form of a <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/3_gml_overview/3_scripts.html">scripted
function</a> which can take no arguments and will be called when
the event is triggered.</p>

<p>Events are added by clicking the <b>Add Event</b> button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../images/icon_addevent.png"> which will open the following
window: <img class="center" src=
"../images/editor_sequences_events.png" alt=
"Sequence Editor Add Event Window"></p>

<p>The events listed here are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Create</b> - This event happens when an instance of the
sequence is first created, and is the very first thing that happens
within a sequence placed in the room through the room editor when a
room is entered.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Destroy</b> - This event is executed when an instance of the
sequence is destroyed, and will be run before the Clean Up event
(see below).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Clean Up</b> - This event will be called after any event
that removes an instance of the sequence from the room. So, it will
be triggered if the sequence is destroyed, if the room ends, or if
the game ends, and is designed to perform any task that you need
performed once when the sequence instance is removed from the game
for any reason. If you have destroyed the sequence instance using,
for example, <tt>layer_sequence_destroy()</tt>, then this event
will be called after the Destroy Event (see above).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Begin Step</b> / <b>Step</b> / <b>End Step</b> - The Step
Event is an event that is checked every single step (frame) of the
game while the sequence instance exists, and is split into three
parts: begin, step and end. For most things the standard step event
will be fine to use, but sometimes you want a bit more control over
what code runs and at what time, so for that you are provided with
the <b>Begin</b> and <b>End</b> step events, and these events will
always be triggered in the same order every step (frame) of the
game. <b>Important!</b> If the sequence is paused then these events
will <i>not</i> be triggered, and when play resumes they will be
triggered the next frame after the sequence starts playing again.
Also note that the order of events is not influenced by the
playhead direction, and even if the sequence is playing backwards,
the events will still be run as Begin, Step and End.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Async Event</b>: This is the equivalent of the object
<a href=
"../../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html">Asynchronous
System Event</a>. <b>Important!</b> If the sequence is paused then
this event will <i>not</i> be triggered.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each event can be assigned a single function which will be
called when the event is triggered. You can assign the function
using the input box for the vent, and clicking the arrow button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../images/icon_openfunction.png"> will open the script editor for
the function to be edited. You can also click the <b>Create New</b>
button at the bottom to create a new script resource with
"boilerplate" functions already defined and ready to be filled in.
Note that you can change the function names to anything you require
and do not have to use the predefined names, and you can also
remove any function definitions that you don't need. It is
important note that functions used for sequence events <b>cannot
take any arguments</b>.</p>

<p>Sequence events can also be added and edited using code. For
more information please see <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/sequences/sequence%20events.html">

<label class="collapse" for="6">Keyframe Controls</label>
<input id="6" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This section of the track editor has the buttons that are used
to for large-scale key control on the specified track or tracks.
The controls are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../images/icon_seq_split.png"> - This is the "Split selected keys"
button. When you have selected one or more track or asset keys in
the dope sheet, you can then click this button and they will be
split into two separate keys at the time line playhead
position:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="../images/editor_sequences_split.gif" alt=
"Split Asset and Parameter Keys"><br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../images/icon_seq_delete.png"> - This is the "Delete selected
keys" button. When you have selected one or more track or asset
keys or parameter keys in the dope sheet, you can then click this
button and they will be deleted:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="../images/editor_sequences_delete.gif"
alt="Delete Parameter Keys"><br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../images/icon_seq_add.png"> - This is the "Record a new key"
button. When you have selected a track or an asset key in the dope
sheet and press this button, new parameter keys will be added to
the asset track as parameter tracks, and the parameter keys will be
added as points in the dope sheet time line at the playhead
position:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="../images/editor_sequences_record.gif"
alt="Add Parameter Keys At Playhead Position"><br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../images/icon_seq_record.png"> - This is the "Automatically
Record Changes" button. When this is enabled, any changes made to
the asset within the canvas will be automatically recorded and the
appropriate parameter tracks and parameter keys added at the
playhead position in the dope sheet. For example, if you move the
playhead from frame 0 to frame 10 and then in the canvas move the
asset 100 pixels to the right, a parameter track will be added for
position, and the parameter keys will be added at frame 0 (the
initial position) and at frame 10 (the playhead position) and when
you press "Play" on the sequence, the asset will move 100px to the
right over ten frames.<br>

<label class="collapse" for="7">Visible / Lock Toggles</label>
<input id="7" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Both asset tracks and parameter tracks have a button to toggle
track visibility <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_track_visible.png"> and to lock the track <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_track_lock.png">. If you
disable the visibility of the track, then it will not be shown when
the sequence is run in a room, nor will it be shown in the sequence
canvas while testing, and toggling the visibility of an asset track
will also toggle the visibility of its parameter tracks. Locking a
track simply means that this track will no longer be able to be
edited in any way. Note that tracks that are invisible will be
drawn faded on the dope sheet, while tracks that are locked will be
drawn with an overlay, so you can immediately see what state each
track is in: <img class="center" src=
"images/track_editor_locked_and_visible.png" alt=
"Locked And Invisible Tracks In The Dope Sheet"></p>

<p>It is worth noting that while locking an asset track will lock
the parameter tracks associated with it, you can then unlock the
individual parameters as required, and parameters themselves can be
locked/unlocked without affecting the status of the main asset
track.</p>

<p>Each asset track you create will be assigned a random colour by
the IDE to make it easier to identify on the Dope Sheet. This
colour can be changed at any time by simply clicking the colour bar
for the track and then selecting the colour you want to use from
the Colour Picker window that opens. Any colour selected for an
asset track will automatically be applied to all the parameter
tracks associated, however you can then edit the colour of each
parameter track individually so it is different if required. Note
that if you then change the asset track colour again, this will
override any changes made to the parameter tracks.</p>

<a name="add_paramter" id="add_paramter"></a> <label class=

type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>Add Parameter</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_add_param.png"> button can be used to add a single
parameter track to the selected asset track. As mentioned earlier
on this page, parameter tracks can be of various different types
depending on the asset that it is related to. Below is a list of
all the different parameter tracks available and what they refer
to, as well as the assets that they can be applied to:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Position</b>: This parameter track can be added to any of
the four sequence asset types (sprites, objects, sounds or
sequences) and is used to set the spacial position within the
sequence for the asset. It takes an X and a Y value.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Rotation</b>: Like the position parameter, the rotation
parameter is available for all sequence assets and can be used to
set the rotation in degrees for the asset. Keep in mind that
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> calculates rotation anti-clockwise,
starting with 0° on the right, so 90° is up, 180° is left and 270°
is down.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Origin</b>: The origin parameter is available for sprite,
object and sequence assets and can be used to set the X and Y
position of the origin of the asset. Changing the origin will
affect how the asset is positioned, rotated and scaled.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Scale</b>: The scale parameter is available for sprite,
object and sequence assets and is used to set the horizontal and
vertical scale of the asset. This will affect how the asset is
rendered in the IDE and at runtime, and is calculated as a scalar
value, where 100% is the default asset size, 50% would be half
size, and 200% would be double the size. Note that you have the
possibility of linking the horizontal and vertical scale values by
clicking the "link" <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_track_link.png"> button. This means that changing one
value will automatically change the other too.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Image Index</b> and Image Speed: These parameters are only
available for sprite and object assets and can be used to change
the current animation frame (see the page on the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/instances/instance_variables/image_index.html">
<tt>image_index</tt></a> for more information) as well as the
current animation speed, which is set using FPS and works the same
way as the value you set for the sprite being used in the sprite
editor.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Colour Multiply</b>: This parameter is only available for
sprite and object assets and can be used to change the current
blend colour for the sprite being drawn. This is the equivalent of
setting the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/instances/instance_variables/image_blend.html">
<tt>image_blend</tt></a> value and any colours set here will be
"multiplied" (ie, blended) with the colour of the sprite, and a
value of white (#ffffffff) indicates that no blending should take
place. Note that when working with this type of track, you can set
the colour by manually typing in the hex value, or you can click
the colour swatch to open the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> Colour
Picker. Note that colours are given in ARGB format, so you can set
a value for alpha using this kind of parameter track (the Colour
Picker also permits you to set the alpha value). This would be the
equivalent of setting the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/instances/instance_variables/image_alpha.html">
<tt>image_alpha</tt></a> for the sprite.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Volume</b>: The volume parameter only applies to sound asset
tracks and can be used to set the gain of the sound (the actual
sound asset gain won't be changed, as it's essentially an emitter
that is used for the asset track in sequences). The volume value is
calculated as a percentage, where 0% is no volume and 100% is full
volume.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Pitch</b>: The pitch parameter only applies to sound asset
tracks and can be used to set the pitch of the sound (as with
volume, the actual sound asset gain won't be changed, as it's
essentially an emitter that is used for the asset track in
sequences). The pitch value is calculated as a percentage, 100% is
the "natural" pitch of the sound, and less than 100% will lower it
while greater than 100% will raise it.<br>

<p>The buttons at the bottom of the track editor are the different
track actions and can be used for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_addasset.png"> - This button will open the Asset
Explorer for you to pick an asset to use as a new track. Once
selected the asset track will be created and frames added into the
Dope Sheet at the current playhead position.<br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_duplicateasset.png"> - When you have selected one or
more asset tracks in the track editor, clicking this button will
duplicate them (along with any parameter tracks they may
contain).<br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_addclipmask.png"> - Clicking this will create a
special <b>clipping mask group</b> where you can give sprites to
use as masks and sprites to be masked. More information on this is
given further down this page.<br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_addgroup.png"> - Clicking this will add a new group
folder to the track editor, which can then be used to better
organise tracks. You can add a track t a group by dragging the
track onto the group folder and you can remove it again by dragging
it out of the folder. Note that any asset that is added to a group
folder will automatically be assigned the folder colour, although
you can then edit the track colour for individual tracks so that it
is different if required.<br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_delete.png"> - As you might expect, clicking this will
delete the selected track(s). If this is an asset track, then all
parameter tracks it contains will also be deleted, although you can
use it on selected parameter tracks to delete them on their own
without removing the asset tracks they are associated with. If you
use this on an empty group folder then the folder will be deleted,
however if there are any tracks in the folder you will be shown a
warning, as deleting a folder will remove all tracks that are
inside of it too.</li>

<h2>Clipping Masks</h2>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <b>Track Actions</b> section above, there is
an action to create what is called a <b>clipping mask</b> group in
the track editor. A clipping mask group contains two sub-sets of
assets that can be used as either the <i>subject</i> or the
<i>mask</i> of the group. Basically the subject is the asset that
is going to be masked, and the mask is the asset that is going to
do the masking: <img class="center" src=
"images/track_clipping_mask.png" alt="Basic Clipping Mask"></p>

<p>The idea behind using a clipping mask is that you add a subject
sprite, and then a mask sprite, and the mask sprite will "hide"
(mask) the subject. You can then use the mask sprite animation, or
move or scale the mask sprite to change the visibility of the
subject (or parts of the subject). To add a subject and mask,
simply drag the sprite, object or sequence from the asset browser
over the folder that you want to add it to (note that you can have
multiple subjects and masks in one folder):<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/track_add_clipping_mask.gif" alt=
"Add A Clipping Mask"></p>

<p><br>
The mask sprite <b>alpha</b> will be used to "hide" whatever
subject is underneath it, where the 100% alpha (opaque) will mask
completely and 0% alpha (will show it). For example, we have this
sprite for masking:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/clipping_mask_sprite.png" alt=
"Clipping Mask Example Sprite"></p>

<p><br>
We can then apply this as a clipping mask to icons to create a
"cooldown" effect, like this:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/clipping_mask_example.gif" alt=
"Animated Clipping Mask Example"></p>

<p><br>
Note that clipping mask groups can be treated as a single item in
the track list and dope sheet, and you can add <i>rotation</i> and
<i>position</i> parameter tracks to the group as a whole. You can
also add the usual parameter tracks to each of the assets used as
the mask or the subject.</p>
