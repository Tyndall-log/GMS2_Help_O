<h2>The Sequences Editor</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_sequences.png" alt=
"The Sequences Editor">
</p>

<p>A <b>sequence</b> is essentially a collection of assets that
perform a dynamic animation over time. They can contain sprites,
instances, sounds and other things, and each of these can be set to
move or change colour, or start/stop animating over time within the
sequence itself. The assets you add are assigned to specific
<b>tracks</b> within the sequence and these tracks can then have
different attributes applied to them - called <b>keys</b> - which
can be static or change over time. All editing of a sequence takes
place in the <b>Sequence Editor</b> which is essentially comprised
of three areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <b>Canvas</b> - where you place the assets that make up the
sequence</li>

<li>the <b>Track Panel</b> - where you add/remove asset tracks and
parameter tracks to your sequence</li>

<li>the <b>Dope Sheet</b> - where you add/remove/edit the keyframes
of the tracks and control how they behave over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note too that you can have sequences within sequences to create
complex animations and effects, and sequences can also be accessed
and changed through code to give you as much control as possible
over how they will be displayed and used in your game. For more
information on the coded aspect of sequences, please see the
section on the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/sequences/index.html">Sequences
Functions</a>.</p>

<p>Before continuing to explain the details of the editor, we'll
take a moment to explain how a sequence is created as well as some
keywords that are used in the descriptions so you'll have a more
thorough understanding of how the Sequences Editor works. The
general workflow for creating a sequence is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>First you'd create your sequence from the Asset Browser, which
will open it the Sequences Editor.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Next you'd drag an asset (sprite, object, sound or sequence)
into the editor canvas.<br>
<br></li>

<li>This will create an <b>Asset Track</b> in the <b>Track
Panel</b> panel, and add an <b>Asset Key</b> to the <b>Dope Sheet
Editor</b>. The asset track is simply the name of the track that
contains the asset, while the asset key is a bar that is drawn to
symbolise the number of frames that the asset will be animated over
in the sequence.<br>
<br></li>

<li>At this point, you'll usually want to position the asset in the
canvas at its initial position for the start of the sequence, and
add in any initial transforms, like scale or rotation.<br>
<br></li>

<li>When you are happy with the initial settings, you will want to
record the <b>parameter keys</b> - which is simply the name given
to the values for scale, rotation and position that a specific
asset key has at a any point in the dope sheet timeline.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Next you'd change the position of the <b>playhead</b> (the
current play position in the dope sheet timeline) and then move or
change the asset transforms and record another parameter key.<br>
<br></li>

<li>All parameter keys are stored in additional <b>parameter
tracks</b> which are a subset of tracks under the main track in the
Track Panel, and you can edit the parameter key data for each
parameter in the track editor.<br>
<br></li>

<li>Now you would repeat the above process for the length of the
sequence, moving, rotating and scaling the asset as required, and
then adding more assets as you need them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below you can find an overview of each of the features of the
sequence editor, and at the bottom of this page are links to pages
that explain the three main features in more depth:</p>

<blockquote><a name="canvas_rulers" id="canvas_rulers"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="1">Rulers / Guides</label> <input id=
"1" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The rulers along the edge of the canvas show you the position of
the things that are placed within it, and are marked from (0, 0)
which is the <i>center</i> of the canvas and the default origin for
the sequence. You can click and drag on the rulers to pull a
horizontal or vertical <b>guide</b> into the sequence, and this
guide can then be used to accurately position the different assets
that are being used, as moving an asset close to one will "snap" it
to the guide. While positioning assets within the sequence,
<b>smart</b> guides will also be temporarily shown indicating the
distance between assets, as well as the distance from the sequence
boundary or center point. <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_sequences_guides.png" alt=
"Guides and Smart Guides in the Sequences Editor"></p>

<p>Note that the boundary of the sequence and the center point
marker lines for the sequence are also considered guides and will
behave the same way as guides added from the rulers, with the
exception that they cannot be edited.</p>

<p>The distance that assets "snap" to guides, as well as other
properties, can be set in the <a href=
"../../1_overview/1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_sequences.html">
Sequences Preferences</a>.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="canvas_view" id="canvas_view"></a> <label class="collapse"
for="2">Canvas View</label> <input id="2" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The canvas view is where you can see a preview of the sequence
canvas, and is where you can edit and position the different assets
that make up your sequence. You can add an asset to the sequence by
simply dragging it from the asset browser and then dropping it into
the canvas, and this will create a new track in the Track Panel,
and also add a <b>key</b> for the asset at the current timeline
playhead position. The following assets can be dropped onto the
canvas in this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sprites</li>

<li>Objects</li>

<li>Sounds</li>

<li>Sequences</li>
</ul>

<p>Each asset added to the canvas can be manipulated in multiple
ways - rotated, transformed, or translated - based on how you
interact with it, as each asset will have a bounding box and a
<b>transform gizmo</b> as well as <b>bounding box controls</b>.
This is explained in more detail on the page about the <a href=
"sequences/the%20sequence%20canvas.html">Sequence Editor
Canvas</a>.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Sound assets when added to a
sequence are essentially sound emitters that play only the given
sound resource.</div>

<p><br>
To navigate around the canvas view, you can use the same basic
controls as the for general Workspace, ie: Use the middle mouse
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_mmb.png"> and drag to pan the canvas (or
alternatively use the space key and the left mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png">), and you can scroll horizontally with
the mouse wheel <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_mmb.png"> or zoom in and out using the
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> / <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> key and the mouse wheel
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_mmb.png">. You can also cut, copy and paste
assets using the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> / <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + "X", <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> /

<a name="broadcast_message" id="broadcast_message"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="3">Broadcast Message</label>
<input id="3" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This button will add a <b>broadcast message</b> to the sequence
timeline in the <b>dope sheet</b>, opening a dialog where you can
add the message to be broadcast. The message will be added wherever
the timeline playhead is in the dope sheet and consists of a simple
string that can be picked up in the <b>Asynchronous System
Event</b> when it is triggered and then acted on.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/editor_sequences_broadcast.gif"
alt="Add A broadcast message to a sequence">
</p>

<p><br>
Once added, the message will be shown in the Dope Sheet, and you
can click the right mouse button <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on it to open a menu where you can
delete the message or edit it. For more information on Broadcast

<a name="keyframe_controls" id="keyframe_controls"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="4">Keyframe Control</label> <input id=
"4" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The <b>keyframe control buttons</b> are one of the ways that you
can add, remove or edit specific keys in the <b>dope sheet</b>. The
buttons are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_seq_split.png"> - This is the "Split selected keys"
button. When you have selected one or more parameter keys in the
dope sheet, you can then click this button and they will be split
into two separate keys at the timeline playhead position:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/editor_sequences_split.gif" alt=
"Split Asset and Parameter Keys"><br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_seq_delete.png"> - This is the "Delete selected keys"
button. When you have selected one or more parameter keys in the
dope sheet, you can then click this button and they will be
deleted:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/editor_sequences_delete.gif" alt=
"Delete Parameter Keys"><br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_seq_add.png"> - This is the "Record a new key" button.
When you have selected an asset key in the dope sheet and press
this button, new parameter keys will be added to the asset track as
parameter tracks, and the parameter keys will be added as points in
the dope sheet timeline at the playhead position:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/editor_sequences_record.gif" alt=
"Add Parameter Keys At Playhead Position"><br>
<br></li>

<li><img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_seq_record.png"> - This is the "Automatically Record
Changes" button. When this is enabled, any changes made to the
asset within the canvas will be automatically recorded and the
appropriate parameter tracks and parameter keys added at the
playhead position in the dope sheet. For example, if you move the
playhead from frame 0 to frame 10 and then in the canvas move the
asset 100 pixels to the right, a parameter track will be added for
position, and the parameter keys will be added at frame 0 (the
initial position) and at frame 10 (the playhead position) and when
you press "Play" on the sequence, the asset will move 100px to the
right over ten frames.<br>

<br>
<a name="sequence_events" id="sequence_events"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="9">Sequence Events</label> <input id="9" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>In a similar way to regular objects, sequences can have
<b>events</b> that can run some code assigned to them. The code is
assigned in the form of a <a href=
"../../3_scripting/3_gml_overview/3_scripts.html">scripted
function</a> which can take no arguments and will be called when
the event is triggered.</p>

<p>Events are added by clicking the <b>Add Event</b> button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_addevent.png">
which will open the following window: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_sequences_events.png" alt=
"Sequence Editor Add Event Window"></p>

<p>The events listed here are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Create</b> - This event happens when an instance of the
sequence is first created, and is the very first thing that happens
within a sequence placed in the room through the room editor when a
room is entered.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Destroy</b> - This event is executed when an instance of the
sequence is destroyed, and will be run before the Clean Up event
(see below).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Clean Up</b> - This event will be called after any event
that removes an instance of the sequence from the room. So, it will
be triggered if the sequence is destroyed, if the room ends, or if
the game ends, and is designed to perform any task that you need
performed once when the sequence instance is removed from the game
for any reason. If you have destroyed the sequence instance using,
for example, <tt>layer_sequence_destroy()</tt>, then this event
will be called after the Destroy Event (see above).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Begin Step</b> / <b>Step</b> / <b>End Step</b> - The Step
Event is an event that is checked every single step (frame) of the
game while the sequence instance exists, and is split into three
parts: begin, step and end. For most things the standard step event
will be fine to use, but sometimes you want a bit more control over
what code runs and at what time, so for that you are provided with
the <b>Begin</b> and <b>End</b> step events, and these events will
always be triggered in the same order every step (frame) of the
game. <b>Important!</b> If the sequence is paused then these events
will <i>not</i> be triggered, and when play resumes they will be
triggered the next frame after the sequence starts playing again.
Also note that the order of events is not influenced by the
playhead direction, and even if the sequence is playing backwards,
the events will still be run as Begin, Step and End.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Async Event</b>: This is the equivalent of the object
<a href=
"../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html">Asynchronous
System Event</a>. <b>Important!</b> If the sequence is paused then
this event will <i>not</i> be triggered.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each event can be assigned a single function which will be
called when the event is triggered. You can assign the function
using the input box for the vent, and clicking the arrow button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_openfunction.png"> will open the script editor for the
function to be edited. You can also click the <b>Create New</b>
button at the bottom to create a new script resource with
"boilerplate" functions already defined and ready to be filled in.
Note that you can change the function names to anything you require
and do not have to use the predefined names, and you can also
remove any function definitions that you don't need. It is
important note that functions used for sequence events <b>cannot
take any arguments</b>.</p>

<p>Sequence events can also be added and edited using code. For
more information please see <a href=

<div class="index_list">
<p>A sequence <b>moment</b> is a position on the timeline where the
sequence can call a function. This is a <a href=
"../../3_scripting/3_gml_overview/3_scripts.html">scripted
function</a> that <b>must have no parameters</b> and when the
moment (frame) given on the timeline is reached, this function will
be called. To set a moment, you simply move the playhead to the
required position and then click the <b>Add Moment</b> button, and
in the dialog that opens you give the name of the function to
call.<br>
<br>

visualisation and setup options for the sequence being edited.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Toggle Canvas Grid</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_canvasgrid.png">: This will toggle on/off the
Sequence Editor canvas grid. This is a grid that <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> draws over the preview canvas to divide it into
sections, and by default is set to 32x32px in size. However if you
click the Grid Menu icon <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasoptions.png"> you will open the grid options:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_sequences_gridcontrols.png"
alt="Sequence Editor Grid Options"> These options permit you to set
the grid colour and alpha, as well as the cell values for the grid
along the X and Y axis. You also have an option to enable or
disable grid snapping here (disabled by default). You can use the
keyboard shortcuts "<tt><b>G</b></tt>" and <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_shift.png"> +
"<tt><b>G</b></tt>" to toggle the grid visibility and grid snapping
respectively.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Canvas Zoom Controls</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_canvaszoom.png">: These buttons control the
current canvas zoom level. You can zoom in or out and clicking the
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_zoomequals.png"> button will reset the canvas to be
1:1 with the room being edited. You can also click the Window Fit
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasfit.png"> to make the entire sequence canvas fit
within the current editor workspace (this will zoom in/out as
appropriate to make it fit). Note that you can also zoom in and out
using the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> and the Mouse Wheel <img style=

the room canvas to be 1:1 with the room settings.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Toggle Widgets</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_togglegizmos.png">: Clicking this will enable or
disable the different widgets visible in the canvas. When enabled
you will see all the widgets associated with the different assets
and the canvas itself, and when disabled these will not be shown,
giving a clearer view of how the sequence looks. Note that this is
enabled by default, and there is a menu available from the right
options button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasoptions.png"> where you can filter what is
visible without having to disable all the different widgets
together. A complete list of these filter options and an
explanation of what they do can be found <a href=
"sequences/the%20sequence%20canvas.html">here</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Toggle Transform Widget Mode</b> <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_transformwidget.png">:
Each asset added to a sequence has a <b>transform widget</b> at its
origin:<br>
<br>
<img class="center" src=
"images/editor_sequences_transformwidget.gif" alt=
"The transform widget for an asset"><br>
<br>
This widget can control how the asset is scaled or rotated, as well
as control its position and the position of the origin of the
asset, however it only shows one of these options at a time.
Clicking this button will switch between the different widget types
or you can click on the options menu <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_canvasoptions.png"> to
directly select the type of control action you want the transform
widget to perform.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Toggle Canvas Frame</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="images/icon_togglecanvas.png">: This button can be used to
toggle the canvas frame on or off (it is on by default). The canvas
frame is simply a guide that is used to judge where elements are
placed in sequence canvas and any elements outside of the frame
will not be rendered. This button also has the following options
menu <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_canvasoptions.png">: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_sequences_canvascontrols.png" alt=
"Sequence Editor Canvas Options"> Here you can set the canvas frame
toggle as well as the size of the canvas. You also have the
possibility of setting a <b>reference image</b>, which is an image
that you select from your computer (it is not imported into the
project) to be used as a background reference for the sequence.
This image is <i>only</i> visible in the Sequence Editor itself and
will <b>not</b> be rendered when the sequence is used in a project.
If you add a reference image you can also set the opacity that it's
drawn at and offset its position within the canvas frame.<br>

"ping-pong" or repeat when looping. Like with the Sprite and Image
editor, this control will not affect the way the sequence plays in
the room when the project is compiled, and is purely a visual guide
for previewing the sequence in the editor.<br>

"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the right edge of an asset key to
change it's length. Note that for sprites and objects, setting the
length to be longer than the animation will cause the animation to
loop over the extra frames. The dope sheet also has controls for
setting the start and end of the <b>clip region</b> for the
sequence, and you can click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> anywhere to set the playhead to that
position. For more information on how to use the dope sheet, please

Sheet</a>.</p>
