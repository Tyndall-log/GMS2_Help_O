<h2>The Asset Browser</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p>The core of your game will be created from assets added to the
<b>Asset Browser</b> located by default on the right of the IDE.
This is where you can add everything that your game requires to
run, including a game room, sprites, objects, paths and a number of
other things. A basic game in <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> will
require a room to run in (new projects will always be created with
a room asset already created), and usually at least one object and
a sprite, although you'll likely use a lot more! <img class=
"center" src="images/qs_assetbrowser.png" alt="Asset Browser"></p>

<p>The Asset Browser is where you'll create and organise the assets
for your game as well as modify certain other aspects like platform
specific sttings and configurations. Below you can find
explanations of each of the different sections.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Search Bar</h4>

<p>The Search Bar is where you can type in some text and use it to
filter what is shown in the main asset list below. For example,
typing "room" will show you all the assets that contain "room" in
their name. To reset the asset list back to it's default view,
simply delete any text from the search bar.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Add Asset</h4>

<p>With the Add Asset button you can choose to add a new asset to
the asset list. Clicking this will open the following window:
<img class="center" src="images/qs_assetbrowser_addasset.png" alt=
"Add Asset To The Asset Browser"></p>

<p>You can choose which of the two views above to use by clicking
either the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_list.png"> list icon or <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_grid.png"> grid icon, and
you can also click the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_import.png"> Import icon to import an already existing
asset from another project. If you don't want to import anything,
then simply select the asset you want to create and click the
<i>Create</i> button at the bottom. Note that you are not limited
to adding only a single asset here, as you can set the number to
create at the bottom of the window, and then click <i>Create</i>
and that number of the chosen asset will be added to the asset
browser for you. All assets created in this way will be added to
the bottom of the asset list, outside of any folders, and also will
be opened in the current workspace ready for editing.</p>

<p>The assets that you can add here are listed further down in this
section of the manual.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Filter</h4>

<p>Clicking the Asset Filter button will open the following window:
<img class="center" src="images/qs_assetbrowser_assetfilter.png"
alt="Filter Assets"></p>

<p>Here you can choose how to filter and display the assets listed
in the asset browser. You can order them from A - Z or from Z - A
as well as choose to order the folders first and then the assets
within the folders, or order everything altogether. If you select
the <b>Custom Order</b> filter, then you can select one or more
assets and drag them up or down the asset browser tree and position
them as you require (note that the "folders first" option will be
disabled).</p>

<p>You can also select one or more asset type to filter and only
the assets that are in the project of those types will be shown in
the asset list. Selecting "Any Type" will reset the filter. You can
also filter using any tags that you have assigned (tags are
discussed further down in this section of the manual). Note that if
you have selected any filter other than "Any Type" then the filter
button will change colour to give a visual indication that
filtering is active.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Extras</h4>

<p>The extras menu permits you to open the following windows (each
of which is discussed separately on the linked pages):</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../2_interface/3_settings/room_manager.html">Room
Manager</a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"../../2_interface/3_settings/configurations.html">Config
Editor</a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"../../2_interface/3_settings/game_options/index.html">Game
Options</a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"../../2_interface/1_editors/included_files.html">included
Files</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Quick Access</h4>

<p>This section of the asset browser is used to give you various
methods to quickly access important or frequently used assets, and
is split into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Recent</b>: Here you can find a list of the most recently
used assets. By default a maximum of 10 assets will be listed here,
but you can change this from the <a href=
"../1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_assetbrowser.html">Asset
Browser Preferences</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Favourites</b>: Once you have added some assets to the asset
list, you may have some that you access frequently at any given
time and so to make things easier you can flag these assets as
"favourites", which will add them to this list and let you quickly
find them. To flag an asset as a favourite use the right mouse
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on it and select <i>Favourite</i> from
the pop-up menu. Note that you can use the right mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png">
again to <i>Unfavourite</i> any asset, and if you use the button on
the main Favourites folder, you can select <i>Clear All</i> to
remove everything.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Room Order</b>: From here you can change the order that your
rooms will run in. All projects require at least one room to run
and the room at the top of the list is the "home" room and will be
the first room entered when the game initially starts (it is
flagged with a "home" icon <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_home.png">). To quickly change room order, simply
click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> and drag the room up or down the list
and then release the mouse button to place it at the new position.
If you click the "home" icon, then you will open the <b>Room
Manager</b> and if you use the right mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on a room
you can create a <b>child</b> room. For more information on room
order and child rooms please see the page on the <a href=
"../../2_interface/3_settings/room_manager.html">Room
Manager</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Saved Filters</b>: When using the filtering options, you may
want to save the selection you've made for future reference. To do
that, set up the filter as explained further up this article, and
then click the right mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on this
option and select <i>Save Filter</i>. The filter will be saved to
this list and you can rename it if required. To use the filter,
simply double click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on it or use the right mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png">
menu option <i>Apply Filter</i>. You can also <i>Delete</i> and
<i>Rename</i> saved filters from the RMB <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> menu.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Tags</b>: All assets in the Asset Browser can be assigned
user-defined <b>Tags</b>. These will then be listed here and you
can use them to filter the assets shown in the asset list and you
can double-click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> any tag (or use the right mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png">
option <i>Filter By Tag</i>) to apply that tag to the asset list
filter. Any applied tags are shown at the bottom of the asset
browser in the <b>Information</b> section. For more information on
tags, see further down in this article.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Game options</b>: Here you can quickly access the various
different <b>Game options</b> for your project. These control
various different aspects of the project related to setting up and
compiling for the different target platforms (what Game Options are
available will depend on <a href=
"../1_getting_started/1_licences.html">what licence type</a> you
have). You can find more information on each of the options listed
from the section on the <a href=
"../../2_interface/3_settings/game_options/index.html">Game
Options</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Asset List</h4>

<p>This section of the asset browser lists all the different assets
that you are using in your game. By default - when you create a new
project - this will be populated with numerous folder groups
labelled with the different kinds of assets that can be added, but
these can be renamed or even removed and you don't have to store
assets of the same kind in each group. For example, you may find it
more useful to ceate a group of assets for each level of your game
rather than for each kind of asset, so you can create a folder
groups called "Level 1", "Level 2", etc... and store all the
different assets for each level in the same folder. How you
organise things really is up to you! <img class="center" src=
"images/qs_assetbrowser_customlist.png" alt=
"Custom Asset List"></p>

<p>To add a new asset to the list you can use the <b>Add Asset</b>
button at the top of the Asset Browser, or you can open the right
mouse button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png"> menu anywhere in the asset list and
then select the resource to create: <img class="center" src=
"images/qs_assetbrowser_createasset.png" alt="Create An Asset"></p>

<p>Once the asset has been created it will be opened in the
workspace and you can rename it to something that is appropriate to
your game, but note that asset names can only be alpha-numeric,
cannot start with a number, and can only use the underscore "_" as
an additional character. You can also use the right button menu to
create new folder groups to contain assets using the <b>Create
Group</b> option, and these can be named anything you wish. If you
want to rename any asset or folder group, then you can do a slow
double-click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on them or use the RMB menu option
"Rename".</p>

<p>An important feature of the asset browser is the ability to
colour assets so they are more immediately recognisable within the
list. You can do this by clicking the right mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
on the asset list node on the left and then selecting a colour from
the colour picker palette that pops up. If you do this on a folder,
then this will also colour any asset contained within the
folder:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/qs_assetbrowser_colourgroup.gif"
alt="Colour A Folder Group">
</p>

<p><br>
Note that when opening the colour picker palette from a node like
this, you can then right-click <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on any of the colour swatches to
generate a custom colour to use.</p>

<p>Individual assets can also be coloured independently of the
group colour by using the RMB on the asset note or by using the
palette at the bottom of the RMB menu (although this can be
disabled from the <a href=
"../1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_assetbrowser.html">Asset
Browser Preferences</a>) and note that you can use <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_shift.png"> or
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> / <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> along with the left mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
to select multiple assets and assign the colour to all of them at
once:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/qs_assetbrowser_colourasset.gif"
alt="Colour An Asset">
</p>

<p><br>
How you colour things is up to you - it can be by asset type, or by
use, or by any other criteria!</p>

<p>One final thing to note with the asset list is that you can
select folders and assets then click <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> and drag
them to move them out of - or into - any other folder group in the
asset list, and you can also delete any or all of the folder groups
if they are not required, keeping the assset list tidy and only
showing the required elements for the project.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Information</h4>

<p>The information bar at the bottom of the Asset Browser shows you
how many assets are in the asset list in total, as well as the
number of assets that are currently selected. This section will
also show any tags that have been used to filter the asset list
(see below for more information on tags), and you can click on them
to remove the tag filter if required. <img class="center" src=
"images/qs_assetbrowser_infotags.png" alt=
"Tags In The Information Bar"></p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h4>Zoom Controls</h4>

<p>The Zoom Controls can be used to make the contents of the asset
browser larger or smaller, with a minimum of 50% to a maximum of
250% of the current DPI of the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> IDE. If
you wish to reset this to the default 100%, then simply
double-click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the percentage value to the left of
the slider. Note that there are a couple of prefernces available to
deal with how this works in the <a href=
"../1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_assetbrowser.html">Asset
Browser Preferences</a>.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2>Tags</h2>

<p>As mentioned in various of the sections above, the asset browser
gives you the ability to add <b>tags</b> to individual assets as
well as to group folders. Tags are a very powerful tool, not only
for organising and filtering the assets listed in the asset
browser, but also when programming your game in general, as you can
use assigned tags in code.</p>

<p>To create a tag you need to use the RMB menu on either a folder
group or an asset and then select the <b>Edit Tag</b> option. This
will bring up the Tag Editor where you can type in the tag you want
to use, and then press <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_enter.png"> to apply it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/qs_assetbrowser_edittags.gif"
alt="Edit Tags">
</p>

<p>You can assign multiple tags to a single item, and you can also
use <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_shift.png"> or <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_ctrl.png"> /
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_cmd.png">
along with the left mouse button <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> to select multiple assets and
assign a tag to all of them at once. You can also add a tag to a
folder group, which will apply it to all the assets within the
folder. Once added, all tags will be visible under the <b>Quick
Access</b> menu and also in the <b>Filter</b> options (as explained
in the sections above), and so can be used to quickly filter the
asset list and show only those items with the chosen tag or
tags.</p>

<p>It is important to note that assets that are created while tags
are part of the active filter <b>will be given those tags
automatically</b>. This means that if you are viewing all assets
under the "Level 1" tag - for example - all new assets created with
this filter active will also have the "Level 1" tag added to them
upon creation.</p>

<p>Finally, tags can also be used in your project code to identify
any asset and then act on it, making it a very powerful tool as you
can code behaviours based on a tag or group of tags. For example,
imagine you have a project with a "<i>Die On Touch</i>" tag. When
programming the project, you can check this tag and code
functionality that is appropriate, then later the artists and level
designers can create new assets of any type and tag them with the
"<i>Die On Touch</i>" tag then use the asset when designing a
level. Any code that has been programmed already to use this tag
will automatically include these new assets.</p>

<p>For more information on using tags in the project code, please
see the section on <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/assets%20and%20tags/index.html">Assets
And Tags</a>.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2>RMB Menu</h2>

<p>When working with the Asset Browser, you can use the right mouse
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on any resource or folder to open a
menu of options: <img class="center" src="images/qs_rmbmenu.png"
alt="Asset Browser RMB Menu"></p>

<p>The exact options available to you will depend on the context
that has been clicked, and below we show the contents when the menu
is opened on an asset or folder group in the Asset List (other
contexts will show some of these but not all):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Create</b> - Create a new asset. On selecting this you will
be presented with a list of the available asset types that can be
created for you to select one. Note that if you open this menu on a
specific asset, there will be an additional option to create a
resource if the same type listed just below so you don't have to
look for the asset type in the list.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Edit (All)</b> - Open the resource properties editor for the
selected asset(s) or folder group (note that you can double click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
on a single asset too to open it for it editing).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Edit Tags</b> - This will open the Tag editor where you can
add or remove tags to the selected asset(s) or folder group(s).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Rename</b> - Rename the asset or the folder group.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Duplicate</b> - Create a duplicate of the asset or assets
that have been selected.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Favourite</b> - Flag an an asset or assets as being a
favourite, adding it to the Quick Access section at the top of the
Asset browser.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Add Existing</b> - Add existing assets from a different
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> project folder. Please note that assets
created using a version anterior to 2.3 will require conversion as
the project file format changed with the 2.3 update. This means it
may be preferable to import the entire project and converting
everything then saving it to a new location if the assets are
imported frequently into other projects.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Add Existing From My Library</b> - Add assets to the asset
list from an item in your Marketplace library. Please note that
Marketplace assets created using a version anterior to 2.3 will
require conversion as the project file format changed with the 2.3
update.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Delete the selected asset(s) from the project.
<b>This cannot be undone!</b><br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Create Group</b> - Add a new folder group to the asset
list.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Expand Children</b> - Expand the currently selected folder
group along with any sub-folders it may contain.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Expand All</b> - Expand all the folder groups in the asset
list.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Contract All</b> - Contract all the folder groups in the
asset list.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Open In New Asset Browser</b> - This option is only
available for folder groups, and it will open the group in a new
Asset browser window containing only the contents of the parent
group the option was selected for.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Open in Explorer</b> - This will open the file explorer on
the location of the file that has been stored for the resource in
your project folder.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Colour Swatches</b> - Here you can select a new colour for
the asset to use. If used on a folder group, all assets within the
folder will get the chosen colour, and if used on one or more
assets, this will override any colour set in for the folder group
(unless you have overriden this option in the <a href=
"../1_getting_started/preferences/prefs_assetbrowser.html">Asset
Browser Preferences</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2>Asset Types</h2>

<p>Now you know how the Asset Browser works, you should get to know
the different types of asset that you can add to it. Below we give
an overview of each of the different asset types available for you
to use in your projects:</p>

<blockquote><a name="animation_curves" id="animation_curves"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="ten"><img style=
"vertical-align:middle; position: relative; left:-26px;" src=
"../../2_interface/1_editors/images/icon_curves.png">Animation
Curves</label> <input id="ten" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">An animation curve is a resource that
contains one or more curves that represent how a value changes over
time, and can use linear interpolation or smooth interpolation to
go between values in the curve. The values you set can be between
-1 and 1 on the vertical axis and the duration along the horizontal
axis is always normalised form 0 to 1, making it easy to target
different time ranges using multipliers in your game code.
Animation curves are comprised of "channels" and each channel can
have it's own curve settings, which permits you to - for example -
describe a spacial position with two channels for the x/y position,
or a colour gradient with 4 channels to represent a colour format.
Animation curve assets can be used when working with sequences and
can also be accessed using code, making them a powerful tool when
creating your games.<br>
<br>
You can find out more about adding animation curves from the
section on <a href=

format for an extension will vary depending on the final target
platform, although in general they are written in C++, C# or
JavaScript, which is then parsed using <a href=

computer and import it into <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> for use in
your game, setting various attributes like size and weight or
style. Once imported and added as a resource, you can then set it
for drawing using the appropriate code or actions.<br>

those listed further down this page):<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Assign Texture Group</b> - When you select this option, you
will be presented with a list of the available texture groups, and
you can then choose one to add the font to or create a new one, if
required. If multiple fonts are selected in the Asset Browser - or
you have selected a group folder of fonts - then all of them will
be added to the chosen texture group. See <a href=

<div class="index_list">Objects are a special resource that we use
to control aspects of a game and to do specific things. Most of the
time they have a sprite associated with them so that you see them
in the game room, but sometimes they are used as a "behind the
scenes" controller to do things related to the user or for timing,
etc... They can be given behaviours and they can react to certain
events as well as to each other, and most of the things you see in
a game are based on objects and their interactions. Note that we
say "based on" because you don't actually place objects directly
into the game room, but rather you place <b>instances</b> of these
objects, which are basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of
the object resource. This is a very important thing to remember as
instances and objects are not the same thing and each have their
own set of functions that can affect them.<br>
<br>
All objects have a set of properties which you can specify in the
object editor, like the sprite, whether it uses physics or not, or
whether it is a "child" object of another one. They also have a
series of built-in variables that can then be used in actions,
scripts and code. These built-in variables are used to define the
position of the instance when placed in the game room, the
animation speed, the direction of movement and a whole host of
other things. To control how the object behaves over time, each
game frame is split into a series of <b>events</b>, so you can add
code or actions into a specific event and it will only run when the
event is triggered, and events can be triggered by things like
mouse button presses or collisions with other instances.<br>
<br>
Objects are in a very real sense the building blocks of your game,
and together with rooms will form the core of any project that you
create.<br>
<br>
The RMB menu for objects contains the following option (as well as
those listed further down this page):<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Open All Event Scripts</b> - Selecting this option will open
all the assigned events for the object in a new workspace as script
tabs.</li>

<input id="three" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">At some point while creating your games you
may need an instance of one of your objects to follow a path
through a level. Now, this can be done by simply creating an array
of positions within the room and then having the instance move
between them, but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to
change, test and adapt for different things. That is when you'd
want to create a path resource.<br>
<br>
The basic idea of the path resource is rather simple - you define a
path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action
(or code) in an event of an object to tell the object to follow
that particular path in the game room. You can set the speed to
follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the
position and orientation of the path within the room too.<br>

<div class="index_list">All games that you make in <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> need at least one room to run (but can have many, many
more) , and a room is basically a space where you place instances
of the objects that make up your game and where the action of the
game will take place. However the Room Editor is one of the most
powerful of resources available to you, since it permits you to not
only add instances of objects, but to set up the "view" into the
game room, add the backgrounds and tiles that are drawn to create
the game world, create extra special effects that are independent
of the object/instance system, and as well as run code
independently of an object. Rooms can also be set to <b>inherit</b>
properties from other rooms, meaning that you can create a single
room with a load of tiles, for example, and then make another room
that inherits these tiles, so that you don't have to re-create them
again.<br>
<br>
The RMB menu for rooms contains the following option (as well as

<ul>
<li><b>Create Child</b> - This will create a new room as a

one or more functions you have written. For example, say you want
to have all your enemy objects create a number of different
instances when they die - like some gold, an explosion and some
blood as well as play a sound. Now you <i>could</i> add all the
required code into each object that requires it, but in general
you'd be better off creating a single function in script resource
and then calling that. This means that you only have to add one
line of code into the objects to call this new scripted function,
and if you wish to change something you only need to change it once
in the script and all the objects will automatically run the new
code, rather than have to go through every object and change the

assets to specific <b>tracks</b> within the sequence. These tracks
can then have different attributes applied to them which can be
static or change over time. All editing of a sequence takes place
in the <b>Sequence Editor</b> which is comprised of the
<b>Canvas</b> - where you place the assets that make up the
sequence - along with the <b>Dope Sheet</b> - which is where you
add/remove/edit the tracks of the sequence and control how they
behave over time. Note that you can have sequences within sequences
to create complex animations and effect, and sequences can also be

<div class="index_list">Shaders are a very powerful tool that can
be used to manipulate the graphics that your game renders to the
screen, permitting incredibly fast effects that can range from, for
example, adding a subtle colour hue to a sprite, right up to full
screen distortion effects. Basically it's a two-part program that
runs directly on the graphics card itself, making it very fast
since the GPU is doing all the work and freeing up CPU cycles for
your game code. The full shader is comprised of a vertex shader
program, and a fragment shader program (also known as a pixel
shader). Both of these tiny programs work together in order to
manipulate what the graphics card renders to the screen. This then
permits you to manipulate in real time the position, colour, and
alpha values that are actually rendered into the display
buffer.<br>

and <tt>OGG</tt> format files.<br>
<br>
In general, <tt>WAV</tt> files are used for any short sound effects
as even though they are generally larger files they will play
instantaneously due to the fact that they do not need any type of
decoding for playing. <tt>MP3</tt> and <tt>OGG</tt> files should be
used for background music or any effect that plays over a longer
period of time or that has a rather large file size. These files
are much smaller than a <tt>WAV</tt> file and but do have a CPU
overhead associated with them as they have to be decoded before
being played.<br>

representations of objects within the games you create. As such, a
sprite is an image drawn using the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> Image
Editor, or made with any external drawing program and imported into
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>. The image used doesn't have to be of a
single static thing either... it can be a "strip" image too, ie:
multiple images in a a single file which can then be used to make a
single animated sprite. For example, the following 10 images form a
sprite for a character who is waving his arms while skydiving.<br>

on the values you give for the various settings. You can then use
these in the room editor (or procedurally through code) to generate
a tile map in your room. They are great for designing any static
