<h2>Sequence Events And Moments</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p>Apart from all the properties listed <a href=
"index.html">here</a> for a sequence struct, you also have the
possibility of adding in special "action" properties to a sequence.
There are three different types of these "action" properties that
can be added to a sequence object - <b>Events</b>. <b>Moments</b>
and <b>Broadcast Messages</b> - and each of these is explained in
more detail in the sections below.</p>

<blockquote><a name="events" id="events"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="1">Events</label> <input id="1" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Sequence objects can have <b>events</b> added to them, and these
events are analogous to the events used by object assets. The
events you assign to a sequence object will occur in a specific
order, either once at a defined moment in the sequence life-cycle,
or every frame that the sequence is running. In this section, we
discuss how these events are handled using code, but they can also
be added using the <a href=
"../../../2_interface/1_editors/sequences.html">Sequence
Editor</a>. Note that that the order of events listed here is not
influenced by the playhead direction, and even if the sequence is
playing backwards, the events will still be run in the order given
below.</p>

<p>The available events are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Create</b>: this is triggered when a sequence instance is
created on a layer.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Destroy</b>: this is triggered when a sequence instance on a
layer is destroyed.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Clean-up</b>: this is triggered when a sequence instance is
garbage collected.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Step</b>: triggered just before the usual object step event.
<b>Important!</b> If the sequence is paused then this event will
not be triggered until the next step after the sequence starts
playing again.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Begin Step</b>: triggered just before the object begin-step
event. <b>Important!</b> If the sequence is paused then this event
will not be triggered until the next step after the sequence starts
playing again.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>End Step</b>: triggered just before the object end-step
event. <b>Important!</b> If the sequence is paused then this event
will not be triggered until the next step after the sequence starts
playing again.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Async System</b>: triggered the same as any object <a href=
"../../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html">Asynchronous
System Event</a> handlers. <b>Important!</b> If the sequence is
paused then this event will not be triggered.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Broadcast Message</b>: triggered during sequence update as a
broadcast message keyframe is encountered.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>All events need to be associated with functions that are defined
in a script, so to set up an event a <a href=
"../../3_gml_overview/variable_scope/method_variables.html">method
variable</a> must be assigned to a property with the correct name
that tells the sequence which event should call the function. The
syntax for this is as follows:</p>

<p class="code">&lt;sequence_struct&gt;.&lt;event_property&gt; =
method(&lt;sequence_struct&gt;, &lt;function_name&gt;);</p>

<p><br>
The sequence struct properties for the different events are as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>event_create</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>event_destroy</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>event_clean_up</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>event_step</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>event_step_begin</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>event_step_end</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>event_async_system</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>event_broadcast_message</tt>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To give an example of use, let's say we want the sequence to
reverse direction when a left mouse button click is detected. We
would first need to create a script with the function that we want
to call, something like this:</p>

<p class="code">/// @function seq_reverse();<br>
<br>
function seq_reverse()<br>
{<br>
if mouse_check_button_pressed(mb_left)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if self.headDirection == seqdir_right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.headDirection
= seqdir_left;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else self.headDirection = seqdir_right;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br></p>

<p><br>
In this function all we're doing is listening for a mouse press and
then reversing the playback direction of the sequence that the
method has been bound to. You'll notice that currently you are not
able to pass any parameters to the functions which are linked to
these properties, and in all cases the <tt>self</tt> variable
within the scope of the function is assigned to be the sequence
instance.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: It's worth noting that in the above
script the <tt>self</tt> identifier can be omitted and is only used
to explicitly show the scope of the method variable being
used.</div>

<p><br>
To assign this to a sequence you would then do something like
this:</p>

<p class="code">var _seq = sequence_get(Sequence1);<br>
_seq.event_step = method(_seq, seq_reverse);<br></p>

<p>We have now assigned a step event to the sequence <i>object</i>
with a function to detect when a mouse is pressed and then change
the playhead direction of the sequence <i>instance</i> after it has
been created in a room.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="moments" id="moments"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"2">Moments</label> <input id="2" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>A sequence <b>moment</b> is a unique code action that is fired
on one or more specified frames as the sequence plays. These code
moments are - like with events (explained above) - simply
predefined <a href=
"../../3_gml_overview/variable_scope/method_variables.html">method
variables</a> that are triggered on the given frame. For example,
say you want a sequence to create a "bullet" instance on a specific
frame of the animation - first you'd need to create the function
that is to be used for this action, something like this:</p>

<p class="code">/// @function seq_shoot();<br>
<br>
seq_shoot = function()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instance_create_layer(sequence.xorigin,
sequence.yorigin, "Instances", obj_Bullet);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br></p>

<p><br>
You would then add this to a frame in the <tt>momentKeyframes</tt>
property of the sequence struct. This is essentially a "special"
track that is only used for this purpose and so can only take
keyframe data that is associated with moment actions that you want
the sequence to have. This track is created in much the same way as
you would create any other track, by creating keyframe structs and
filling them with keyframe data, where channel 0 is the only
channel that you can use and the track type is
<tt>seqtracktype_moment</tt>. Below is an example of how this would
be created, using the function we defined above to fire on the
given moments (frames):</p>

<p class="code">var _seq = sequence_get(my_Seq);<br>
var _k = array_create(3);<br>
_k[0] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_moment);<br>
_k[0].frame = 60;<br>
_k[1] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_moment);<br>
_k[1].frame = 120;<br>
_k[2] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_moment);<br>
_k[2].frame = 180;<br>
var _d = array_create(1);<br>
_d[0] = sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_moment);<br>
_d[0].channel = 0;<br>
_d[0].event = method(_d[0], seq_shoot);<br>
_k[0].channels = _d;<br>
_k[1].channels = _d;<br>
_k[2].channels = _d;<br>
_seq.momentKeyframes = _k;<br></p>

<p><br>
The above code will simply set frames 60, 120, and 180 of the
"moment" track to call the method <tt>seq_shoot</tt>. You'll notice
that currently you are not able to pass any parameters to the
functions which are used for each moment, and in all cases the
<tt>self</tt> variable within the scope of the function is assigned
to be the sequence instance (you generally don't need to use
<tt>self</tt> but under some special cases it may be useful).</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="messages" id="messages"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"3">Broadcast Messages</label> <input id="3" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Sequences can be made to generate <b>broadcast messages</b>,
which simple strings that are added to specific frames along the
animation timeline, and when that point in the timeline is reached,
then the string will be broadcast out to all object instances that
listen for it. You can add these messages in the IDE using the
<a href="../../../2_interface/1_editors/sequences.html">Sequence
editor</a>, but they can also be created and edited using code.</p>

<p>To create a broadcast message on a sequence using GML, you need
to add them to a frame in the <tt>messageEventKeyframes</tt>
property of the sequence struct. This is essentially a "special"
track that is only used for this purpose and so can only take
keyframe data that is associated with the broadcast messages that
you want the sequence to have. This track is created in much the
same way as you would create any other track, by creating keyframe
structs and filling them with keyframe data, where channel 0 is the
only channel that you can use and the track type is
<tt>seqtracktype_message</tt>. Below is an example of how this
would be created:</p>

<p class="code">var _seq = sequence_get(my_Seq);<br>
var _k = array_create(2);<br>
_k[0] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_message);<br>
_k[0].frame = 60;<br>
_k[1] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_message);<br>
_k[1].frame = 120;<br>
var _m1 = array_create(2);<br>
_m1[0] = "Hello";<br>
_m1[1] = "World";<br>
var _m2 = array_create(1);<br>
_m2[0] = "This is a Broadcast Message";<br>
var _d1 = array_create(1);<br>
_d1[0] = sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_message);<br>
_d1[0].channel = 0;<br>
_d1[0].events = _m1;<br>
var _d2 = array_create(1);<br>
_d2[0] = sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_message);<br>
_d2[0].channel = 0;<br>
_d2[0].events = _m2;<br>
_k[0].channels = _d1;<br>
_k[1].channels = _d2;<br>
_seq.messageEventKeyframes = _k;</p>

<p><br>
You'll notice that the message text is passed to the keyframe data
channel as an array. This is because you can broadcast multiple
messages on the same frame, and have different object instances
listen for them and react differently depending on the message they
are actually expecting.</p>

<p>Once a broadcast message has been emitted by the sequence, you
can parse it using the <i>Other</i> &gt; <i>Broadcast Message</i>
event in object instances, which is explained in detail <a href=
"../../../2_interface/1_editors/sequences/broadcast%20messages.html">
here</a>.</p>
