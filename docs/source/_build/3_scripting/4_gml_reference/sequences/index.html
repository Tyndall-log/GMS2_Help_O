<h2>Sequences</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p>Sequences are usually created in the IDE using the <a href=
"../../../2_interface/1_editors/sequences.html">Sequence
editor</a>, but they can also be created and edited using code.
However, before looking at the functions available, it's important
to understand the way that sequences are defined in GameMaker and
the different terms that will be used.</p>

<p>To start with, at the top level, you have a <b>sequence
element</b>. This is what you place on a layer in a room, either
through the Room Editor or in code using the appropriate <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/index.html">layer functions</a>. The layer
element has no real properties other than an element ID value, but
this ID is required to use the above mentioned layer functions to
change the sequence playback or to access the sequence data.</p>

<p>Next you have <b>sequence objects</b> and <b>sequence
instances</b> much like you have general objects and instances. A
sequence <i>object</i> is the base resource as you created it in
the <b>Asset Browser</b> or using the function <a href=
"sequence_create.html"><tt>sequence_create()</tt></a>, and the
sequence <i>instance</i> is the "copy" of that sequence object that
has been placed in a room as an element on a layer. Think of
sequence objects as blueprints and sequence instances as the
creation from those blueprints. Sequence objects and instances are
<a href="../../3_gml_overview/11_structs.html">structs</a> and -
unlike regular objects - a sequence object struct can be edited at
runtime, which will affect all further instances of that sequence
when you create them as elements (and any editing done to a
sequence object will <b>not</b> be reset by restarting the game or
the room using the <tt>room_restart()</tt> or
<tt>game_restart()</tt> functions). The sequence instance struct
contains a few parameters to control playback and things (this is
explained in more detail below) as well as the <b>sequence data</b>
struct.</p>

<p>Finally, as mentioned above, you have the <b>sequence data</b>,
which is another struct. This struct contains <i>all</i> the data
about the sequence. The tracks it contains, the propertys those
tracks have, the playback speed and much more. The exact details of
this structs contents are outlined below, but basically consists of
<b>asset track</b> structs and <b>parameter track</b> structs which
use <b>keyframe data</b> to actually perform actions while the
sequence plays.</p>

<p>Sequence elements are dealt with using the room <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/index.html">layer functions</a>, but for
sequence objects, instances and data we have the following
functions:</p>

<div class="index_list">
<ul>
<li><a href="sequence_exists.html">sequence_exists</a>
</li>

<li><a href="sequence_create.html">sequence_create</a>
</li>

<li><a href="sequence_destroy.html">sequence_destroy</a>
</li>

<li><a href="sequence_get.html">sequence_get</a>
</li>

<li><a href="sequence_track_new.html">sequence_track_new</a>
</li>

<li><a href="sequence_keyframe_new.html">sequence_keyframe_new</a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"sequence_keyframedata_new.html">sequence_keyframedata_new</a>
</li>

<li><a href="sequence_get_objects.html">sequence_get_objects</a>
</li>

<li><a href=
"sequence_instance_override_object.html">sequence_instance_override_object</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Before using these functions to create or edit sequences, we
recommend that you read the detailed descriptions given below for
the struct properties. A general overview of how to create a new
sequence would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create the new sequence object using the function <a href=
"sequence_create.html"><tt>seqeunce_create()</tt></a> and store the
sequence object index in a variable. This index gives you access to
the sequence object struct.<br>
<br>

<p class="code">myseq = sequence_create();</p>
<br>
<br></li>

<li>Set the sequence object top level values like length, play
mode, play speed, etc... For example:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">myseq.length = 120;<br>
myseq.loopmode = seqplay_pingpong<br></p>
<br>
<br></li>

<li>Before you can add tracks to the sequence object, you need to
create them, so you'd now create an array of <i>asset</i> tracks
that have been defined with the function <a href=
"sequence_track_new.html"><tt>sequence_track_new()</tt></a>. Note
that in code, there is really no difference between asset tracks
and parameter tracks - they are all simply tracks and how they
behave will depend on the type od track you create and whether they
are assigned as sub-tracks to a top level track or not. So, you
would create a track for an asset, and then assign sub-tracks for
the different parameters to it and these sub-tracks would act as
the <i>parameter</i> tracks for the asset. The example below
creates a single graphics asset track that will be added to the
sequence later:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">var mytracks = array_create(1);<br>
mytracks[0] = sequence_track_new(seqtracktype_graphic);<br></p>
<br>
<br></li>

<li>Each asset track needs to have some data to tell the sequence
how it will look, or its position , etc... and this is added in the
form of <i>keyframes</i>. At the top level for an asset track, you
can set keyframes for various things (listed in the section on the
Track Struct, below), but note that as these are asset track
keyframes, they won't be interpolated and will simply change the
value they refer to when the given frame is reached. Each keyframe
is a struct that is added to an array, and then this array is
assigned to the asset track. To create the keyframe struct we would
call the function <a href=
"sequence_keyframe_new.html"><tt>sequence_keyframe_new</tt></a> and
to populate the keyframe with the required data, we would use the
function <a href=
"sequence_keyframedata_new.html"><tt>sequence_keyframedata_new</tt></a>:<br>

<br>

<p class="code">// Create a new keyframe struct for a graphics
asset track and add it to an array (as you can have multiple keys
in a frame)<br>
var graphickeys = array_create(1);<br>
graphickeys[0] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_graphic);<br>
// Set the graphics keyframe top level data for the keyframe
position and length, etc...<br>
graphickeys[0].frame = 0;<br>
graphickeys[0].length = 1;<br>
graphickeys[0].stretch = true;<br>
graphickeys[0].disabled = false;<br>
// Create the channel data that will go into this keyframe (again
an array, as each key can have multiple channels of keyframe
data)<br>
var graphickeydata = array_create(1);<br>
graphickeydata[0] =
sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_graphic);<br>
graphickeydata[0].spriteIndex = spr_Platform;<br>
graphickeydata[0].channel = 0;<br>
// Add the keyframe data channels to the graphics track
keyframe<br>
graphickeys[0].channels = graphickeydata;<br>
// Add the definied keyframes to the track<br>
mytracks[0].name = "TestGraphicTrack";<br>
mytracks[0].keyframes = graphickeys;<br></p>
<br>
<br></li>

<li>We now need to create a parameter track which we'll assign as a
sub-track to the graphics track we just created. This will be done
in a similar way as shown above, only now we need to give the track
a name that shows its purpose, in this case "position" as we'll be
using this track to move the graphics track track over the course
of the sequence animation frames:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">// Create a new parameter track struct for the
position of the graphic<br>
var paramtracks = array_create(1);<br>
paramtracks[0] = sequence_track_new(seqtracktype_real);<br>
paramtracks[0].name = "position";<br>
paramtracks[0].interpolation = true;<br>
// Create the keyframe struct to hold the parameter channel data
and set the frame position for the keyframe<br>
var paramkeys = array_create(2);<br>
paramkeys[0] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_real);<br>
paramkeys[0].frame = 0;<br>
paramkeys[1] = sequence_keyframe_new(seqtracktype_real);<br>
paramkeys[1].frame = 120;<br>
// Create the keyframe data structs<br>
var paramkeydata1 = array_create(2);<br>
paramkeydata1[0] =
sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_real);<br>
paramkeydata1[0].channel = 0; // Channel 0 for a position track is
the X position<br>
paramkeydata1[0].value = 0;<br>
paramkeydata1[1] =
sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_real);<br>
paramkeydata1[1].channel = 1; // Channel 1 for a position track is
the Y position<br>
paramkeydata1[1].value = 0;<br>
var paramkeydata2 = array_create(2);<br>
paramkeydata2[0] =
sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_real);<br>
paramkeydata2[0].channel = 0;<br>
paramkeydata2[0].value = room_width;<br>
paramkeydata2[1] =
sequence_keyframedata_new(seqtracktype_real);<br>
paramkeydata2[1].channel = 1;<br>
paramkeydata2[1].value = room_height;<br>
// Assign the keyframe data structs to the channels for each
key<br>
paramkeys[0].channels = paramkeydata1;<br>
paramkeys[1].channels = paramkeydata2;<br>
// Assign the keys to the parameter track<br>
paramtracks[0].keyframes = paramkeys;<br></p>
<br>
<br></li>

<li>With that done, the final thing to do is assign the parameter
track as a sub-track to our main graphics asset track that we
created at the beginning and then assign these tracks to the
sequence which we can then create an instance of in the room:<br>
<br>

<p class="code">mytracks[0].tracks = paramtracks;<br>
myseq.tracks = mytracks;<br>
layer_sequence_create("Assets_1", 0, 0, myseq);<br></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The above instructions create a very simple sequence object that
draws a sprite at the (0, 0) position <i>of the sequence</i> and
then move it to the bottom-right corner and back in a loop. As
mentioned, there are a number of places where you need to access
different structs to give or get data about the sequence, and the
sections below list all the different properties that these structs
contain:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object" id="object"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="1">The Sequence Object Struct</label> <input id="1"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>A sequence object is a struct with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>name</tt>: This is the name of the sequence as a string and
you can get or set this value as required. Note that sequences
created using the function <a href=
"sequence_create.html"><tt>sequence_create()</tt></a> will not have
a name and this will simply be an empty string "".<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>loopmode</tt>: This is the playback mode of the sequence
object and can be get or set. It will return (or can be set to) the
following constants:

<div class="compat">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Constant</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>seqplay_oneshot</tt>
</td>
<td>The sequence will play once then stop when finished.</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr class="alt">
<td><tt>seqplay_loop</tt>
</td>
<td>The sequence will loop, with the playhead going back to the
start when it reaches the end of the playback region.</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>seqplay_pingpong</tt>
</td>
<td>The sequence will loop, with the playhead reversing direction
when it reaches the end of the playback region.</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>playbackSpeed</tt>: This specifies the playback speed of
the sequence, which is interpreted as either frames-per-second or
frames-per-game-frame depending on the <tt>playbackSpeedType</tt>
(see below). You can get or set this value.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>playbackSpeedType</tt>: This specifies how the
<tt>playbackSpeed</tt> should be interpreted and you can get or set
this value. You can use one of the following constants to set the
value (or one of these constants will be returned if checking the
property):

<div class="compat">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Constant</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>spritespeed_framespersecond</tt>
</td>
<td>Specifies that <tt>playbackSpeed</tt> should be interpreted as
frames-per-second</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr class="alt">
<td><tt>spritespeed_framespergameframe</tt>
</td>
<td>Specifies that <tt>playbackSpeed</tt> should be interpreted as
frames-per-game-frame.</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>length</tt>: The length of the sequence in frames. You can
get or set this value, but note that making a sequence shorter may
cause issues if a sequence instance referencing this sequence has
its playhead set to past the new length.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>volume</tt>: This is a scalar value from 0 to 1 that is
used to scale the volume of all audio tracks in the sequence. You
can get or set this value and it will modify the global audio
output for all tracks - for example, if you have an audio track
with a volume of 0.8 and then set the sequence <tt>volume</tt>
property to 0.5, the audio track will have a final volume of
0.4.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>xorigin</tt>: This is the origin of the sequence along the
X axis. You can get or set this value.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>yorigin</tt>: This is the origin of the sequence along the
Y axis. You can get or set this value.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>messageEventKeyframes</tt>: This allows access to the
message event keyframes for the sequence. You can get or set these
message events, and when getting this property an array of keyframe
structs is returned, and for setting the property you should supply
an array of keyframe structs. For more information, please see the
page on <a href="sequence%20events.html">Sequence Events and
Moments</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>momentKeyframes</tt>: This allows access to the moment
event keyframes for the sequence. You can get or set these moment
events, and when getting this property an array of keyframe structs
is returned, and for setting the property you should supply an
array of keyframe structs. For more information, please see the
page on <a href="sequence%20events.html">Sequence Events and
Moments</a>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>tracks</tt>: This allows access to the list of <b>asset
tracks</b> on the top level of the sequence. You can get or set
this property, and when getting this property an array of track
structs is returned, and for setting the property you should supply
an array of track structs. For more information, please see the
section below on <b>Track Structs</b>.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if you want to access the properties of a sequence
that has been created in the asset browser, you must first call the
function <a href="sequence_get.html"><tt>sequence_get()</tt> on the
asset index to retrieve the sequence object struct.</a></p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="instance" id="instance"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"2">The Sequence Instance Struct</label> <input id="2" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When placed in a room as an element on a layer, a sequence
instance will have the following properties in its struct:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>sequence</tt>: This is the ID of the <b>sequence object</b>
struct that the sequence instance has been created from (see above
for more details). You can get or set this struct, and so change
the base sequence that the instance is referencing.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>headPosition</tt>: This is the current playhead position
(in frames) for the sequence instance. You can get or set this
value, but note that setting it to a value greater or less than the
currently defined play region will have different effects depending
on the type of playback set for the sequence. See <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_headpos.html"><tt>layer_sequence_headpos()</tt></a>
for more information.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>headDirection</tt>: This is the current playback direction
for the sequence instance. You can get or set this value using the
following constants:

<div class="compat">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Constant</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>seqdir_right</td>
<td>The sequence will play frames in an incremental order from left
to right</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>

<tr class="alt">
<td>seqdir_left</td>
<td>The sequence will play frames in a decremental order from right
to left</td>
<td>-1</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<br>
Note that you can use the layer functions <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_get_headdir.html"><tt>layer_sequence_get_headdir()</tt></a>
and <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_headdir.html"><tt>layer_sequence_headdir()</tt></a>
to get or set this value without having to access the struct
directly.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>speedScale</tt>: This property can be used to get or set
the playback speed scale. The speed scale is a <i>multiplier</i>,
where 1 is the default playback speed and values less than 1 will
slow the playback and values larger than 1 will speed it up, eg: a
value of 0.5 would be half playback speed, while a value of 2 would
be double playback speed. Note that you can use the layer functions
<a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_get_speedscale.html"><tt>layer_sequence_get_speedscale()</tt></a>
and <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_speedscale.html"><tt>layer_sequence_speedscale()</tt></a>
to get or set this value without having to access the struct
directly.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>paused</tt>: You can check this property to see if a
sequence has been paused or not, and it will be <tt>true</tt> if it
has, or <tt>false</tt> otherwise. This is a <b>read-only</b>
property, but you can use the layer function <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_pause.html"><tt>layer_sequence_pause()</tt></a>
to pause playback, and <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_play.html"><tt>layer_sequence_play()</tt></a>
to resume it again if required. You can also check this property
using the layer function <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_is_paused.html"><tt>layer_sequence_is_paused()</tt></a>
rather than check the property in the struct directly.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>finished</tt>: You can check this property to see if a
sequence has finished playing or not, returning <tt>true</tt> if it
is finished playing, and <tt>false</tt> otherwise. This is a
<b>read-only</b> property, and will only ever return <tt>true</tt>
for tracks that are not set to loop or ping-pong. You can also
check this property using the layer function <a href=
"../rooms/sequences/layer_sequence_is_finished.html"><tt>layer_sequence_is_finished()</tt></a>
rather than check the property in the struct directly.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>elementID</tt>: This property holds the ID of the sequence
<i>element</i>. This iD is a simple identifying value that is
associated with a layer in the room editor, and it can then be used
with the appropriate <a href="../rooms/sequences/index.html">layer
functions</a> to find the layer the sequence has been assigned to
or to change certain sequence properties without having to deal
with the struct.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>activeTracks</tt>: This property will hold an array of
"evaluation" structs containing information on the current state of
each <b>asset track</b> in the sequence (graphics, sequence, audio
etc...). These are only the top-level tracks, and the array
returned is <b>read-only</b>. For the contents of the asset track
struct returned in each array entry, please see the section
below.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
The following list contains the properties that may be available to
you when accessing a track struct (as returned by the
<tt>activeTracks</tt> property of the parent sequence struct,
explained above). Each asset track struct may have some or all of
the following properties, depending on the type of asset the track
is referencing (note that you can get or set all these properties,
except where specified as read-only), and all values returned are
the for the <i>current playhead position</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>matrix</tt>: This is the transformation matrix used to draw
the track (sprite, instance and sequence tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>posx</tt>: The position of asset in the sequence along the
X axis for the track at the current playhead position (all
assets).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>posy</tt>: The position of asset in the sequence along the
Y axis for the track at the current playhead position (all
assets).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>scalex</tt>: The scale of asset in the sequence along the X
axis for the track at the current playhead position (sprite,
instance and sequence tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>scaley</tt>: The scale of asset in the sequence along the Y

<li><tt>yorigin</tt>: The Y origin of the asset for the track (all
assets).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>width</tt>: The width (in pixels) of the asset for the
track (sprite, instance and sequence tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>height</tt>: The height (in pixels) of the asset for the
track (sprite, instance and sequence tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>imageindex</tt>: The image index for the asset on the track
in the sequence at the current playhead position (sprite and
instance tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>imagespeed</tt>: The image speed for the asset on the track
in the sequence at the current playhead position (sprite and
instance tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>colourMultiply</tt>: The colour multiply value for the
asset on the track in the sequence at the current playhead position
(sprite, instance and sequence tracks). This value will be an array
of four values with the format [A, R, G, B]. Note that the values
for each component are expressed as between 0 and 1, where 0
corresponds to the HEX value #00 and 1 corresponds to the HEX value
#FF (0 - 255 as shown in the colour picker for colour multiply
tracks in the Sequences Editor).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>gain</tt>: The gain (volume) of the track at the current
playhead position (audio tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>pitch</tt>: The pitch of the track at the current playhead
position (audio tracks).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>track</tt>: The track data struct that this track is based

(all assets, a <b>read-only</b> value).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>activeTracks</tt>: This is an array of evaluation structs

<li><tt>name</tt>: When creating an asset track, the name you give
here can be any string that you require to identify the track,
however for parameter tracks, you need to specify specific strings
to tell <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> what kind of parameter track you
are creating (these strings are only applicable to the
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> and <tt>seqtracktype_colour</tt>
parameter track types):<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>"position" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> this indicates that the contents of this
track should be used as positional data.<br>
<br></li>

<li>"scale" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> this indicates that the contents of this
track should be used as scaling data.<br>
<br></li>

<li>"rotation" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> this indicates that the contents of this
track should be used as rotation data.<br>
<br></li>

<li>"blend_multiply" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_colour</tt> this indicates that the contents of
this track should be used as colour multiplication data. The
keyframe data for such a track should be an array of four values
with the format [A, R, G, B]. Note that the values for each
component are expressed as between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to
the HEX value #00 and 1 corresponds to the HEX value #FF (0 - 255
as shown in the colour picker for image blend tracks in the
Sequences Editor).<br>
<br></li>

<li>"image_speed" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> this indicates that the contents of this
track should be used as the image speed value.<br>
<br></li>

<li>"image_index" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> this indicates that the contents of this
track should be used as the image index value.<br>
<br></li>

<li>"image_angle" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> this indicates that the contents of this
track should be used as the image angle value.<br>
<br></li>

<li>"image_blend" - when set on a track which is of type
<tt>seqtracktype_colour</tt> this indicates that the contents of
this track should be used as the image blend value. The keyframe
data for such a track should be an array of four values with the
format [A, R, G, B]. Note that the values for each component are
expressed as between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to the HEX value
#00 and 1 corresponds to the HEX value #FF (0 - 255 as shown in the
colour picker for colour multiply tracks in the Sequences
Editor).<br>
<br></li>
</ul></li>

<li><tt>tracks</tt>: This property allows access to the list of
tracks which are children of this track. When getting this property
an array of track structs is returned, and when setting this
property an array of track structs should be specified.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>visible</tt>: This indicates whether this track is visible
(the value is <tt>true</tt>) or not (the value is <tt>false</tt>).
You can get or set this value and if a track not visible then none
of its child tracks will be drawn either.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>keyframes</tt>: This property allows access to the list of
keyframe structs for the track. When getting this property an array
of keyframe structs is returned, and when setting this property an
array of keyframe structs should be specified.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</div>

<a name="keyframe" id="keyframe"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"4">The Keyframe Struct</label> <input id="4" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Each track will have one or more keyframe struct assigned to it
(which you can get from the <tt>keyframes</tt> property of the
track struct), and each one will have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>frame</tt>: The position (in frames) along the timeline for
the keyframe. Default value is 0.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>length</tt>: The length of the keyframe. Default value is
1, and when set to larger values then the track property that the
keyframe refers to will be maintained at the initial value for the
duration of the length given. Note that the <tt>stretch</tt>
property will override this if set to <tt>true</tt>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>stretch</tt>: If this property is set to <tt>true</tt> then
the keyframe stretches to either the next keyframe for the track or
to the end of the track if it's the last keyframe. You can get or
set this value, and the default value is <tt>false</tt>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>channels</tt>: This property allows access to the list of
keyframe data structs for the channels of the track. When getting
this property an array of keyframe data structs is returned, and
when setting this property an array of keyframe data structs should
be specified.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<a name="keyframe_data" id="keyframe_data"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="5">The Keyframe Data Struct</label> <input id="5"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When you define a keyframe for a track, you need to also define
the data that will be associated with it. This is comprised of
different <i>channels</i>, and each channel can be given a specific
type of data depending on what type of track you are setting the
keyframe data for. These properties are:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>channel</tt>: This is the channel that the keyframe data
should be applied to. It is a positive integer value starting at 0,
and it's worth noting that when creating parameter tracks for
"position" or "scale" keyframes, then you need to use very specific
channel values. These are: channel 0 is the X position or the X
scale, channel 1 is the Y position or Y scale.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>spriteIndex</tt>: The index of the sprite asset to use for
the track. This property is only available for tracks of the type
<tt>seqtracktype_graphic</tt> and you can get or set it.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>soundIndex</tt>: The index of the audio asset to use for
the track. This property is only available for tracks of the type
<tt>seqtracktype_audio</tt> and you can get or set it.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>playbackMode</tt>: The playback mode for the sound. This
property is only available for tracks of the type
<tt>seqtracktype_audio</tt> and you can get or set it. The property
should be one of the following constants:

<div class="compat">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Constant</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>seqaudiokey_loop</td>
<td>The sound will loop when played.</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr class="alt">
<td>seqaudiokey_oneshot</td>
<td>The sound will only play once then stop.</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<br></li>

<li><tt>curve</tt>: This property requires an animation curve
struct (see <a href=
"../animation%20curves/animcurve_create.html">here</a> for more
information) and is only available for tracks of the type
<tt>seqtracktype_real</tt>. If no curve struct is used then the
value for this property will be -1.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>value</tt>: This property is simply a value that is
associated with the keyframe data channel, and is only available
for tracks of the type <tt>seqtracktype_real</tt> when no
<tt>curve</tt> struct is supplied.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>colour</tt>: This property returns (or requires, if being
set) an array for the colour value of the keyframe with the format
[A, R, G, B]. This is only available for tracks of the type
<tt>seqtracktype_colour</tt>. Note that the values for each
component should be expressed as between 0 and 1, where 0
corresponds to the HEX value #00 and 1 corresponds to the HEX value
#FF (0 - 255 as shown in the colour picker for colour tracks in the
Sequences Editor).<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>sequence</tt>: This property will return (or requires, if
being set) a sequence object struct and is only available for
tracks of the type <tt>seqtracktype_sequence</tt>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>objectIndex</tt>: This property will return (or requires,
if being set) an object index and is only available for tracks of
the type <tt>seqtracktype_instance</tt>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>events</tt>: This property allows access to the
<b>events</b> and <b>broadcast messages</b> associated with the
keyframe data struct. You can get or set this property, and when
getting it an array of strings is returned, and when setting it an
array of strings should be specified. For more information on
events, please see the section <a href=
"sequence%20events.html">Sequence Events And Moments</a>. This
property is only available for tracks of the type
<tt>seqtracktype_message</tt>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><tt>event</tt>: This property will return (or can be set to)
the <a href=
"../../3_gml_overview/variable_scope/method_variables.html">method</a>
associated with the keyframe data struct. If no method has been
specified or you wish to remove the method, then the property
should be -1. This property is only available for tracks of the
type <tt>seqtracktype_moment</tt>.<br>
